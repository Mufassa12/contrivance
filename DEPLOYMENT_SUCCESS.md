## Deployment Execution

### Service Health Checks
- [ ] PostgreSQL container healthy
- [ ] Auth service responding at `/health`
- [ ] User service responding at `/health`
- [ ] Contrivance service responding at `/health`
- [ ] Gateway service responding at `/health`
- [ ] Frontend serving static files

### Authentication Flow
- [ ] User registration working (`POST /auth/register`)
- [ ] User login working (`POST /auth/login`)
- [ ] JWT token generation and validation
- [ ] Token refresh mechanism working
- [ ] Protected endpoints requiring authentication

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Spreadsheet creation working
- [ ] Spreadsheet listing and retrieval
- [ ] Row and column operations
- [ ] Data persistence to database
- [ ] WebSocket connections established
- [ ] Real-time updates functioning

### API Endpoints Testing
```bash
# Health checks
curl http://localhost:8080/auth/health
curl http://localhost:8080/api/users/health  
curl http://localhost:8080/api/spreadsheets/health

# Authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"testpass123","name":"Test User"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"testpass123"}'

# Spreadsheet operations (with JWT token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8080/api/spreadsheets
```

### Frontend Verification
- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] Login/registration forms working
- [ ] Spreadsheet grid renders correctly
- [ ] D3.js visualizations display
- [ ] WebSocket connection indicator shows connected
- [ ] Responsive design on mobile devices

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Load testing completed
- [ ] Response times within acceptable limits
- [ ] Database query performance optimized
- [ ] Memory usage within expected ranges
- [ ] CPU utilization stable under load

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Application logs accessible and structured
- [ ] Error tracking and alerting configured
- [ ] Performance metrics collection active
- [ ] Database monitoring in place
- [ ] Health check endpoints monitored

### Security Verification
- [ ] HTTPS enforced (production)
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Rate limiting active
- [ ] SQL injection protection verified
- [ ] XSS protection enabled
- [ ] CSRF protection implemented

### Data Validation
- [ ] Sample data created and accessible
- [ ] Data persistence verified
- [ ] Backup and restore tested
- [ ] Data migration scripts working
- [ ] Real-time updates functioning across clients

## Rollback Plan

### Quick Rollback Steps
1. Stop current deployment: `docker-compose down`
2. Switch to previous image tags
3. Restore database from backup (if schema changes)
4. Start previous version: `docker-compose up -d`
5. Verify rollback successful

### Rollback Verification
- [ ] All services healthy after rollback
- [ ] Data integrity maintained
- [ ] User sessions still valid
- [ ] Core functionality working

## Production Maintenance

### Daily Checks
- [ ] Service health status
- [ ] Error log review
- [ ] Performance metrics review
- [ ] Database connection pool status

### Weekly Checks
- [ ] Security vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Log rotation and cleanup
- [ ] Database performance analysis
- [ ] Backup verification

### Monthly Checks
- [ ] Dependency updates evaluation
- [ ] Capacity planning review
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Disaster recovery testing

## Environment Variables Checklist

### Critical Variables
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- [ ] `JWT_SECRET` - JWT signing secret (256+ bits)
- [ ] `DB_PASSWORD` - Database password
- [ ] `RUST_LOG` - Logging level

### Service URLs (Internal)
- [ ] `AUTH_SERVICE_URL`
- [ ] `USER_SERVICE_URL` 
- [ ] `CONTRIVANCE_SERVICE_URL`

### Optional Configuration
- [ ] `CORS_ORIGINS` - Allowed CORS origins
- [ ] `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` - Rate limiting
- [ ] `JWT_EXPIRATION` - Token expiration time

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify DATABASE_URL format and credentials
- Check network connectivity between services
- Ensure PostgreSQL is accepting connections
- Verify database exists and migrations applied

### Authentication Issues
- Check JWT_SECRET is set and consistent
- Verify token expiration settings
- Check CORS configuration for frontend
- Validate user creation and password hashing

### Performance Issues
- Monitor database query performance
- Check connection pool settings
- Verify resource limits (CPU/memory)
- Review log files for bottlenecks

### Frontend Issues
- Verify API_URL environment variable
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Validate WebSocket connection
- Test responsive design on various devices

Deployment is considered successful when:
- [ ] All health checks pass
- [ ] Core user workflows function correctly
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Security measures are active
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting operational
- [ ] Rollback plan tested and ready
