# ROOT CAUSE FOUND & FIXED! üéØ

## The Problem
Discovery responses weren't persisting because **all API calls were returning 401 Unauthorized**.

## Console Logs Showed:
```
‚ùå [API] GET /discovery/accounts/001gL00000RQBY9QAP - Status: 401
‚ùå [DISCOVERY] Error loading sessions, will create on save: Error: API Error: 401
‚ùå [SAVE] Error saving responses: Error: API Error: 401
```

## Root Cause
The `getAuthToken()` function in DiscoveryService.ts was **only checking for `'authToken'` key** in localStorage:

```typescript
// BROKEN - Only checks for 'authToken'
function getAuthToken(): string | null {
  return localStorage.getItem('authToken');
}
```

But the browser's localStorage had tokens under different keys:
- `'token'` ‚úÖ (This one actually has the real JWT)
- `'access_token'` 
- `'auth_token'`
- `'ruggerai-auth-token'`
- `'authToken'` ‚ùå (Empty/not found)

So the function was returning `null`, which meant:
- No Authorization header was added to API requests
- Backend rejected all requests with 401
- Sessions couldn't be retrieved
- Responses couldn't be saved
- Data appeared to disappear

## The Fix

Updated `getAuthToken()` to check multiple token key locations (just like the salesforce.ts service already does):

```typescript
function getAuthToken(): string | null {
  // Try multiple possible token keys (some apps use different names)
  const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken') 
    || localStorage.getItem('token')
    || localStorage.getItem('access_token')
    || localStorage.getItem('auth_token')
    || localStorage.getItem('ruggerai-auth-token');
  
  if (token) {
    console.log('‚úÖ [AUTH] Token found in localStorage');
  } else {
    console.warn('‚ùå [AUTH] No token found in localStorage');
  }
  
  return token;
}
```

Also added logging to `getHeaders()` to confirm the Authorization header is being added:
```typescript
if (token) {
  headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${token}`;
  console.log('‚úÖ [AUTH] Authorization header added to request');
}
```

## Impact

Now when users:
1. Select an account ‚Üí API can retrieve existing sessions ‚úÖ
2. Fill in responses ‚Üí Auto-save works with proper auth ‚úÖ
3. Click Save ‚Üí Session and responses are persisted ‚úÖ
4. Navigate back ‚Üí Responses load because data was actually saved ‚úÖ

## Files Changed

- **frontend/src/services/DiscoveryService.ts**
  - Fixed `getAuthToken()` to check multiple keys
  - Added auth logging to `getHeaders()`
  - +16 lines of code

## What We Learned

Different parts of the app store the JWT token under different keys. The solution is to check multiple locations, using the first one that exists. This is a common pattern when working with multiple authentication libraries or legacy code that doesn't standardize token storage.

## Deployment Status

‚úÖ Frontend rebuilt in Docker container
‚úÖ Container restarted
‚úÖ Ready for testing
‚úÖ All 8 containers still healthy

## Next Steps

1. Test the Discovery flow again
2. Check console for auth logs
3. Verify sessions and responses now persist
4. Celebrate! üéâ
