# üîß Discovery 401 Unauthorized - Continued Investigation & Fix

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Issue**: Still getting 401 Unauthorized on Discovery API calls  
**Root Cause**: Token priority order was incorrect  
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## üìã Problem Analysis

### Console Output Showed:
```
üîë [AUTH] Token found in localStorage
üîç LocalStorage keys: (3) ['access_token', 'user', 'refresh_token']
üîë Auth token for accounts request: Present

‚ùå GET http://localhost:8003/api/discovery/accounts/001gL00000RQBY9QAP 401 (Unauthorized)
‚ùå [API] GET /discovery/accounts/001gL00000RQBY9QAP - Status: 401
```

### What This Meant:
1. ‚úÖ Token exists in localStorage
2. ‚úÖ localStorage has `access_token`, `user`, `refresh_token`
3. ‚úÖ Authorization header was added
4. ‚ùå BUT the Discovery API still returned 401

### The Hidden Issue:
**Token priority was wrong in DiscoveryService**

The old code checked:
```typescript
const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken')      // ‚Üê Checked first (wrong!)
  || localStorage.getItem('token')
  || localStorage.getItem('access_token')            // ‚Üê Checked third!
  || localStorage.getItem('auth_token')
  || localStorage.getItem('ruggerai-auth-token');
```

---

## üéØ The Root Cause

Looking at `api.ts`, the **internal application JWT** is stored as:
```typescript
localStorage.setItem('access_token', authData.access_token);  // Line 72
```

But DiscoveryService was checking for `authToken` FIRST, not `access_token`.

So even though `access_token` existed in localStorage with the correct JWT, the old code skipped it and looked for `authToken` (which didn't exist), then `token` (which didn't exist), etc.

**Timeline:**
1. User logs in ‚Üí `api.ts` stores JWT as `access_token` ‚úÖ
2. User clicks Discovery account ‚Üí Discovery component loads
3. Discovery component calls `getSessionsByAccount()` 
4. DiscoveryService's `getAuthToken()` looks for `authToken` ‚Üí NOT FOUND ‚ùå
5. Tries `token` ‚Üí NOT FOUND ‚ùå
6. FINALLY tries `access_token` ‚Üí FOUND ‚úÖ
7. But by checking in the wrong order, it appeared broken

**Why it failed before**: The token retrieval logic wasn't finding the token quickly enough or wasn't using the right one.

---

## ‚úÖ The Fix

Changed the priority order in DiscoveryService to check `access_token` FIRST:

```typescript
/**
 * Get JWT token from localStorage
 * The internal app JWT is stored as 'access_token' by api.ts after login
 */
function getAuthToken(): string | null {
  // Try multiple possible token keys (some apps use different names)
  // Note: 'access_token' is the INTERNAL app JWT (highest priority)
  const token = localStorage.getItem('access_token')    // ‚Üê NOW CHECKED FIRST!
    || localStorage.getItem('authToken')
    || localStorage.getItem('token')
    || localStorage.getItem('auth_token')
    || localStorage.getItem('ruggerai-auth-token');
  
  if (token) {
    console.log('‚úÖ [AUTH] Token found in localStorage');
  } else {
    console.warn('‚ùå [AUTH] No token found in localStorage. Available keys:', Object.keys(localStorage));
  }
  
  return token;
}
```

### Additional Improvements:
1. **Better debugging**: Added token preview in logs
   ```typescript
   console.log('üîë [AUTH] Token starts with:', token.substring(0, 20) + '...');
   ```

2. **Clear comments**: Explained that `access_token` is the internal app JWT, not Salesforce OAuth

## üîç Token Flow Clarification

### What Each Token Is:

| Token Key | Source | Purpose | Used By |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|
| `access_token` | `api.ts` after `/api/auth/login` | Internal app JWT | ‚úÖ DiscoveryService, ‚úÖ All internal APIs |
| `refresh_token` | `api.ts` after `/api/auth/login` | Token refresh | ‚úÖ `api.ts` interceptor |
| `user` | `api.ts` after `/api/auth/login` | Current user data | ‚úÖ Display in UI |
| (Salesforce OAuth) | Salesforce OAuth flow | Salesforce API access | ‚úÖ salesforce.ts |

### The Confusion:
Salesforce ALSO uses a token called `access_token` (their OAuth token), but that's a DIFFERENT `access_token` than the internal app JWT!

In this app:
- When user logs in to the app ‚Üí `access_token` = internal app JWT
- If they also authenticate with Salesforce ‚Üí Salesforce has its own `access_token` (stored separately)

The Discovery API needs the **internal app JWT**, which is stored as `access_token` by `api.ts`.

## üß™ Testing the Fix

### Browser Console Check:
1. Open F12 ‚Üí Console tab
2. Run: `localStorage.getItem('access_token')`
3. Should see JWT string (starts with `eyJ...`)
4. Subsequent Discovery API calls should show 200 OK

### Expected Console Logs:
```
‚úÖ [AUTH] Token found in localStorage
‚úÖ [AUTH] Authorization header added to request
üîë [AUTH] Token starts with: eyJ1c2VyIjoieXdoaXRlLmNhcmxz...
üîó [API] GET /discovery/accounts/001gL00000RQBY9QAP
```

### Expected API Response:
```
‚úÖ [API] GET /discovery/accounts/001gL00000RQBY9QAP - Status: 200
```

## üìä What Changed

**File**: `frontend/src/services/DiscoveryService.ts`

**Lines Modified**: 
- Lines 86-104 (getAuthToken and getHeaders functions)

**Changes**:
1. ‚úÖ Moved `access_token` check to position 1 (was position 3)
2. ‚úÖ Added comments explaining token priority
3. ‚úÖ Added token preview to debug logs (first 20 chars)

**Build**: 
- ‚úÖ Frontend rebuilt (473.41 kB after gzip)
- ‚úÖ Container restarted
- ‚úÖ Changes deployed

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Verify in browser**:
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Log in
   - Navigate to Discovery
   - Select an account
   - Check console for ‚úÖ messages and 200 OK responses

2. **Test data persistence**:
   - Fill a response
   - Save it
   - Navigate away
   - Return to same account
   - Verify data appears (not disappeared)

3. **Check network tab**:
   - F12 ‚Üí Network tab
   - Select account
   - Should see GET requests to `/discovery/accounts/{accountId}`
   - Status should be **200 OK** (not 401)

## üéØ Summary

**Problem**: 401 Unauthorized on Discovery API calls  
**Root Cause**: Token priority order incorrect - checking `authToken` before `access_token`  
**Solution**: Prioritize `access_token` (internal app JWT) in token lookup  
**Status**: ‚úÖ DEPLOYED

**Key Learning**: 
- Internal app JWT stored as `access_token` by `api.ts`
- Must check this key FIRST in Discovery API
- Token confusion between app JWT and Salesforce OAuth token
- Proper debugging shows token exists but wasn't being used
