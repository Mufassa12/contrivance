# Iteration Update - Discovery Module Data Persistence Investigation

## What We Did

### 1. ✅ Identified the Problem
- User saves discovery responses
- Navigates away from Discovery page  
- Returns and selects the same account
- **Expected**: Responses should load from database
- **Actual**: No responses appear (appears data wasn't saved)
- **Root cause**: Unknown - no console logging to track the issue

### 2. ✅ Added Comprehensive Logging
Implemented detailed debug logging at every step of the data flow:

**Frontend Logging** (Discovery.tsx):
```
📱 Account loading from Salesforce
🔎 Account selection and ID tracking
🔍 Session retrieval from API
📋 Sessions list received
✅ Existing session found
📊 Session data with responses retrieved
📝 Response list being processed
🔄 Individual response processing
🎯 Final response map built
💾 Saving all responses started
```

**API Logging** (DiscoveryService.ts):
```
🔗 GET /discovery/accounts/{accountId} - Request sent
✅ GET /discovery/accounts/{accountId} - Response received
❌ GET /discovery/accounts/{accountId} - Error with status code
🔗 GET /discovery/sessions/{sessionId} - Request sent
✅ GET /discovery/sessions/{sessionId} - Response received
🔗 POST /discovery/sessions/{sessionId}/responses - Request sent
✅ POST /discovery/sessions/{sessionId}/responses - Response received
```

### 3. ✅ Fixed TypeScript Compilation Issue
- Fixed union type error in `handleSaveResponses` function
- Used type assertions to access `questions` property
- Build now completes successfully

### 4. ✅ Rebuilt All Docker Containers
```bash
✔ contrivance-frontend          Built (473 kB gzipped)
✔ contrivance-auth              Built
✔ contrivance-user              Built  
✔ contrivance-core              Built
✔ contrivance-salesforce        Built
✔ contrivance-gateway           Built
✔ contrivance-postgres          Running (Healthy)
✔ contrivance-redis             Running
```

**All 8 containers are running and healthy:**
```
✔ Container contrivance-redis          Running
✔ Container contrivance-postgres       Healthy
✔ Container contrivance-auth           Running
✔ Container contrivance-salesforce     Running
✔ Container contrivance-user           Running
✔ Container contrivance-core           Running
✔ Container contrivance-gateway        Running
✔ Container contrivance-frontend       Running
```

### 5. ✅ API Health Check Passing
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8003/api/public/discovery/health
{
  "service": "discovery",
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### 6. ✅ Created Debugging Guide
New file: `DISCOVERY_PERSISTENCE_DEBUG.md`
- Comprehensive testing procedures
- Network tab inspection guide
- Database query examples
- Diagnostic flowchart
- Common issues & solutions

## What's Ready for Testing

### Browser Console Debugging
Open DevTools → Console tab and:
1. Select an account on Discovery page
2. Watch for 🔍, 📋, ✅ emojis showing data loading
3. Fill in a response and save
4. Go back and return to same account
5. Check if 📋 and ✅ logs appear showing responses loaded
6. Review all logs to see where the flow breaks

### Network Tab Inspection  
Open DevTools → Network tab and:
1. Clear network history
2. Select account
3. Watch for API calls:
   - GET /api/discovery/accounts/{id} → should return sessions array
   - GET /api/discovery/sessions/{id} → should return responses array
4. Verify response payloads contain expected data

### Database Query
```bash
# View all discovery sessions
docker exec contrivance-postgres psql -U contrivance_user -d contrivance -c \
  "SELECT id, account_id, vertical, status FROM discovery_sessions LIMIT 5;"

# View responses for a session
docker exec contrivance-postgres psql -U contrivance_user -d contrivance -c \
  "SELECT question_id, response_value FROM discovery_responses WHERE session_id = 'UUID' LIMIT 5;"
```

## Current Status

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Frontend Build** | ✅ Success | No TypeScript errors, 473 kB gzipped |
| **Backend Builds** | ✅ Success | All services compiled |
| **Containers** | ✅ Running | All 8 containers healthy |
| **API Health** | ✅ Healthy | Discovery service responding |
| **Logging** | ✅ Added | Comprehensive debug logs throughout |
| **Data Flow** | 🔄 Testing | Ready for detailed investigation |

## What We Need Now

To identify the root cause, we need to:

1. **Run the test flow** as described in DISCOVERY_PERSISTENCE_DEBUG.md
2. **Capture console logs** showing where data disappears
3. **Check network responses** to see what the API returns
4. **Query the database** to verify if data is actually saved
5. **Identify the breakpoint** - is it:
   - User_id mismatch in session query?
   - API not returning saved responses?
   - Frontend not processing responses correctly?
   - Data not being saved to database at all?

## Files Modified

1. **frontend/src/pages/Discovery.tsx**
   - Added extensive debug logging
   - Fixed TypeScript compilation issue
   - +~80 lines of logging code

2. **frontend/src/services/DiscoveryService.ts**
   - Added API request/response logging
   - +~30 lines of logging code

3. **DISCOVERY_PERSISTENCE_DEBUG.md** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive debugging and testing guide
   - 300+ lines

## Next Actions

1. **Test with new logging** - Run the flow and share console output
2. **Analyze API responses** - Check what /discovery/accounts/{id} returns
3. **Query database** - Verify if save operations are actually working
4. **Pinpoint issue** - Identify where the data flow breaks
5. **Implement fix** - Once root cause is identified
